## Summary

This fitness application provides a user friendly interface that encompasses all the essential functions of the fitness app. Moreover, to allow you to tailor your experience according to your needs, the fitness application allows you to use this app either as a registered user (through login or signup) or a guest. If you are just interested in using a calorie calculator and chatbot, you can simply use this application as a guest. However, if you are also interested in using a calendar to keep track of all your workout information and visualize your progress using chart, you will need to use this application as a registered user by logging in or signing up if you do not already have your account. For a registered user, all your workout information will be saved so that you will still have access to it when you use this application in the future.

Key features:

1. User login/signup
  
2. Calorie Calculator 

3. Calendar - Enter workouts to be stored in calendar and view previous workouts. 

4. ChatBot - Receive chatbot workout suggestions based on goals.
